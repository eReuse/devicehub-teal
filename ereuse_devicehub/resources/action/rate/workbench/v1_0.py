class RateAlgorithm(BaseRate):
    """The algorithm that generates the Rate v1.0.

    Rate v1.0 is mainly based on 3 components (Processor, RAM and Data Storage)
    and 2 visual grades (one for appearance aspects and other for functionality aspects).

    From components we take into account their main characteristics and
    also some tests and benchmarks. In particular:

    * Processor:
        - Cores
        - Speed
        - Benchmark processor

    * RAM:
        - Size
        - Speed

    * Data Storage:
        - Size
        - Benchmark data storage (Read and write speed)

    Step by step to compute Rate v1.0:

    1. Normalization the components characteristics.
        Normalized the characteristics of the components between 0 and 1.
        with xMin and xMax and standardize the values applying
        the following formula:

        **Normalization characteristic value = (x −xMin)/(xMax −xMin)**

    2. Merge the characteristics of every component in one score for component.


    3. Merge the components individual rates into a single components rate.
        We calculate this rate using the weighted harmonic mean.
        We establish all the components weights, 50% for processor,
        20% for data storage, 30% for RAM.
        The result is a unique performance score (components rate).

    4. Grouping all categories aspects sum all in unique final rate.
        To get Functionality and Appearance Rates values, only directly
        related a value for each grade.

    **Final Rate = Components Rate + Functionality Rate + Appearance Rate**

    Final Rate are ranged from 0 to 4.7.

    Do not call directly this class, but use
    :meth:`ereuse_devicehub.resources.action.models.RateComputer.compute`,
    which then calls this.
