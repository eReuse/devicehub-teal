# Devicehub

Devicehub is a distributed IT Asset Management System focused in 
reusing devices, created under the project 
[eReuse.org](https://www.ereuse.org).

Our main objectives are:

- To offer a common IT Asset Management for donors, receivers and IT 
  professionals so they can manage devices and exchange them.
  This is, reusing â€“and ultimately recycling.
- To automatically recollect, analyse, process and share 
  (controlling privacy) metadata about devices with other tools of the
  eReuse ecosystem to guarantee traceability, and to provide inputs for 
  the indicators which measure circularity.
- To highly integrate with existing IT Asset Management Systems.
- To be decentralized.

Devicehub is built with [Teal](https://github.com/bustawin/teal) and
[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org).

## Installing
The requirements are:

- Python 3.5.3 or higher. In debian 9 is `# apt install python3-pip`.
- PostgreSQL 9.6 or higher with pgcrypto and ltree.
  In debian 9 is `# apt install postgresql-contrib`
- passlib. In debian 9 is `# apt install python3-passlib`.
- Weasyprint requires some system packages. 
  [Their docs explain which ones and how to install them](http://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html).

Install Devicehub with *pip*: `pip3 install ereuse-devicehub -U --pre`.

## Running
Download, or copy the contents, of [this file](examples/app.py), and
call the new file ``app.py``.

Create a PostgreSQL database called *devicehub* by running 
[create-db](examples/create-db.sh):
 
- In a Debian 9 bash terminal, execute the following two commands:
  1. `sudo su - postgres`.
  2. `bash examples/create-db.sh devicehub dhub`, 
     and password `ereuse`.
- In MacOS: `bash examples/create-db.sh devicehub dhub`, 
  and password `ereuse`.

Create the tables in the database by executing in the same directory 
where `app.py` is:

```bash
$ flask init-db
```

Finally, run the app:

```bash
$ flask run
```

The error `flask: command not found` can happen when you are not in a 
*virtual environment*. Try executing then `python3 -m flask`. 

See the [Flask quickstart](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/quickstart/)
for more info.

## Administrating
Devicehub has many commands that allows you to administrate it. You
can, for example, create a dummy database of devices with ``flask dummy``
or create users with ``flask create-user``. See all the
available commands by just executing ``flask`` and get more information
per command by executing ``flask command --help``.

## Understand the software
See the [docs](docs/index.rst) to understand how the software works and 
the design principles.

### Use the API
Checkout [Swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/ereuse/devicehub/0.2)
to see the schemas and endpoints (we are working  in making it 
interactive).

Use postman as an example of how to use the API.

## Testing
To run the tests you will need to:

1. `git clone` this project.
2. Create a database for testing executing `create-db.sh` like
   the normal installation but changing the first parameter
   from `devicehub` to `dh_test`: `create-db.sh dh_test dhub` and
   password `ereuse`.
3. Execute at the root folder of the project `python3 setup.py test`.

## Generating the docs
1. `git clone` this project.
2. Install plantuml. In Debian 9 is `# apt install plantuml`.
3. Execute `pip3 install -e .[docs]` in the project root folder.
3. Go to `<project root folder>/docs` and execute `make html`. 
   Repeat this step to generate new docs.
   
To auto-generate the docs do `pip3 install -e .[docs-auto]`, then
execute, in the root folder of the project 
`sphinx-autobuild docs docs/_build/html`.
