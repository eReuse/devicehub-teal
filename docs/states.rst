States
######
.. note:: In construction.

A mutable property of a device result of applying an
:ref:`actions:Action` to it.

States are represented as properties in :ref:`devices:Device` and
subâ€“types. They can be steps in a workflow
(like ``sold`` and ``payed``, part of a trading), or properties
describing computed values from applying events (like a list of owners,
or a quality rating).

There are three types of states:

* **Trading**: a workflow of states resulting from applying the action
  :ref:`actions:Trade`.
* **Physical**: a workflow of states resulting from applying
  physical actions (ref. :ref:`actions:Actions`).
* **Attributes**: miscellaneous device properties that are not part of
  a workflow.
